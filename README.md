## **Python scripts**


These are various python scripts that I've written as part of interview processes,
as well as my own edification and practice. Here's a list of what they are in case
you want to use any for reference. Most of these are written for hackerrank exercises.





- leapYear.py - given a year as input, determine if it's a Leap Year.


- permutations.py - given a string and int as input, pritn permutations on separate lines.

  > "HACK 2"


- phoneVanity.py: Vanity number search (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/vanity-number-search)
  given an array of alpha strings and a string of numeric numbers, find all phone numbers that
  match all vanity codes.

  reports every stock open price and high price for the day for all dates in the range (inclusive).
